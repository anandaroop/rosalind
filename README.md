# Rosalind [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/rosalind.svg?style=svg&circle-token=cb49eab5b9f460be61b18d9eef1153b3db16e02a)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/rosalind)

Rosalind is an admin app for large-batch operations on artist and artwork genomes (Artsy-created genomes as well as "partner-applied categories").

Among its major components are [Rails 5](http://rubyonrails.org) + [Kinetic](https://github.com/artsy/kinetic) on the backend and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) on the frontend.

You can read more about [the motivation for the app](https://github.com/artsy/rosalind/pull/1).

## Development Setup

Depends on Ruby 2.3, Node 6.9, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

- Fork [the repo](https://github.com/artsy/rosalind) to your account in Github

- Clone it locally to your machine

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<youruser>/rosalind.git
cd rosalind
```

- Set up the application environment:
```sh
cp .env.example .env # then edit .env as needed
```

- You can create a `ClientApplication` and obtain an auth token for your app by opening a Gravity console (in local or staging, depending which Gravity you want to access) and [following these instructions](https://github.com/artsy/gravity/blob/master/doc/ApiAuthentication.md#get-an-application-key)

- Take the `gravity_application_id` , `gravity_application_secret`, and `gravity_xapp_token` returned by the previous step and add them to your `.env` file.

- The `BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM` token is required for bundling and can be obtained from an existing Kinetic app's configuration, e.g.: `heroku config --app volt-staging | grep -i bundle`
